# Canvas Snake

I created this good old classic to play with HTML5 canvas a bit and get some practice creating a game.

    TODO:

        [x] - Add scoring
        [x] - Add collisions on walls and snake
        [x] - Difficulties
        [x] - Fix apple positions and create them as instances.
        [x] - Multiple apple support
        [ ] - Refactor the snake and canvas object to their own classes
        [ ] - Abstract out as classes
        [x] - Standardize the size of the canvas (edges aren't a full gridSize)
        [x] - Apples spawn off canvas because of above
        [ ] - Random snake start
        [ ] - End a crash before going off stage (check ahead a grid space, if snake is only 1 cell, it looks like it goes off the screen)
        [ ] - Game over and reset
        [ ] - Themes
        [ ] - Munch sound ðŸ™‚ https://freesound.org/people/PapercutterJohn/sounds/318608/
        [ ] - Adjust canvas size on resize
    
    BUG:
        [ ] - Some weirdness when turning. Snake head turns after already moving an additional block forward.
