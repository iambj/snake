# Canvas Snake

    TODO:

        [x] -  Add scoring
        [x] - Add collisions on walls and snake
        [x] - Difficulties
        [ ] - Fix apple positions and create them as instances.
        [ ] - Game over and reset
        [ ] - Random snake start
        [ ] - Standardize the size of the canvas (edges aren't a full gridSize)
        [ ] - Abstract out as classes
        [ ] - Multiple apple support
        [ ] - Themes
        [ ] - Munch sound ðŸ™‚ https://freesound.org/people/PapercutterJohn/sounds/318608/
    
    BUGS:
        [ ] - Some weirdness when turning quick after an apple (not urgent)
        [ ] - Throttle (didn't work) the input to skipFrames? (ie. use throttle.js to disallow spamming causing the snake to double back.)
